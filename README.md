Beep is a lightweight, anonymous social networking platform designed for terminal enthusiasts. Built for Python/Termux, it allows users (“Beepers”) to:
Create and share posts anonymously
Follow other users or browse the global feed
Comment, share, and quote posts
Chat privately or in rooms
Enjoy offline-friendly feeds using a hybrid local-first replication system
Posts are stored locally with optional replication for global and followed feeds, ensuring privacy, fast access, and offline availability.
